Whenever the ridge value was changed for the Elastic Nets method, it hardly changed the mean y-distance of each data point from the regression line, but it appears that the mean y-distance decreased as the ridge value increased."

    "**Explanation:** LASSO and Ridge Regression both have the possibility of underfitting or overfitting the regression line that is created for a group of data, as they are calculated with a single regularizer. With Elastic Nets, however, L1 and L2 regularization are combined, producing a model that more properly fits the data."

    "**Explanation:** The purpose of a regularizer in a regression function is to limit the importance of outlying data values with multicollinear data points. This 'regulation' of these outlying data points assists in the creation of a more accurate regression model. It also seeks to prevent the overfitting or underfitting of a regression model through a collection of data."

    "**Examples:** One example where a regularizer would benefit a predictive data model is in a model representing the relationship between a country's GDP and its per capita income. As one would expect, as a country's GDP increases, its per capita income is likely to increase also, and a regularizer would limit the influence of certain countries where this trend isn't necessarily true. A second example where using a regularizer can provide a more robust model is when looking for correlations between quality of education and poverty within a region, a regularizer can be utilized to find a model that isn't overfitting."

    "**Explanation:** A specific example that we identified in the file test.csv are students 7 and 12 who spent roughly the same amount on electronics, but differing amounts on the other items. In total, Student 7 spent roughly 1,556.2 credits on items $x_{0}, x_{1}$, and $x_{2}$, and Student 2 spent roughly 1,786.5 credits on those items. Given how the x-values differed between the two students, when creating a regression line using OLS regression, the line would most likely be a skewed representation of the data. However, when adding a regularizer, the margin of error that is present using OLS is decreased, making it a better representation of the relationship between the data points."
