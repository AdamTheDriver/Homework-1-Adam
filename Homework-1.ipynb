Whenever the ridge value was changed for the Elastic Nets method, it hardly changed the mean y-distance of each data point from the regression line, but it appears that the mean y-distance decreased as the ridge value increased."

    "**Explanation:** LASSO and Ridge Regression both have the possibility of underfitting or overfitting the regression line that is created for a group of data, as they are calculated with a single regularizer. With Elastic Nets, however, L1 and L2 regularization are combined, producing a model that more properly fits the data."

    "**Explanation:** The purpose of a regularizer in a regression function is to limit the importance of outlying data values with multicollinear data points. This 'regulation' of these outlying data points assists in the creation of a more accurate regression model. It also seeks to prevent the overfitting or underfitting of a regression model through a collection of data."

    "**Examples:** One example where a regularizer would benefit a predictive data model is in a model representing the relationship between a country's GDP and its per capita income. As one would expect, as a country's GDP increases, its per capita income is likely to increase also, and a regularizer would limit the influence of certain countries where this trend isn't necessarily true. A second example where using a regularizer can provide a more robust model is when looking for correlations between quality of education and poverty within a region, a regularizer can be utilized to find a model that isn't overfitting."

    "**Explanation:** A specific example that we identified in the file test.csv are students 7 and 12 who spent roughly the same amount on electronics, but differing amounts on the other items. In total, Student 7 spent roughly 1,556.2 credits on items $x_{0}, x_{1}$, and $x_{2}$, and Student 2 spent roughly 1,786.5 credits on those items. Given how the x-values differed between the two students, when creating a regression line using OLS regression, the line would most likely be a skewed representation of the data. However, when adding a regularizer, the margin of error that is present using OLS is decreased, making it a better representation of the relationship between the data points."

However, as the degree increases past ten, the errors siginificantly increase due to the increased importance of outlying data values when plotting the regression line."
